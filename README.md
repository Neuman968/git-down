## GitDown

This is a rewrite from the ground up of the popular GitUp
library available on Mac. It is built using Kotlin and 
Compose Desktop from Jetbrains and will run On Mac + Linux + Windows.

I wouldn't recommend trying to use this for any real
world projects until I have a stable release published.
