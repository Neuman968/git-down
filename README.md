## GitDown


This is a rewrite from the ground up of the popular GitUp
library available on Mac. It is built using Kotlin and 
Compose Desktop from Jetbrains.


The big benefit of this project is that it is multiplatform.
I'm actually doing all development on a Linux machine,
but in this should work on Windows and Mac as well.


I wouldn't recommend trying to use this for any real
world projects until I have a stable release published.


I'm also using the application itself as my primary Git
companion along the way so that all the irksome bugs
will gnaw away at me until I fix them, not to mention
complete lack of features at this point.


As you can see this is still in early development and
only a few bits and bops here and there are functional
